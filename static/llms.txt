# CloakBin

> Zero-knowledge encrypted pastebin for sharing secrets safely.

## What is CloakBin?

CloakBin is a privacy-first pastebin that uses client-side encryption. Your data is encrypted in your browser before it ever reaches our servers. We never see your plaintext content.

## How it works

1. You paste your content
2. Content is encrypted with AES-256-GCM in your browser
3. Only the encrypted blob is sent to our server
4. The encryption key stays in your URL fragment (never sent to server)
5. Recipients decrypt in their browser using the key from the URL

## Features

- **Zero-knowledge encryption**: Server never sees plaintext
- **Password protection**: Add an extra layer of encryption
- **Burn after read**: Paste self-destructs after first view
- **Expiry options**: 1 hour, 24 hours, or 7 days
- **No tracking**: No accounts, no cookies, no analytics
- **Open source**: Code available on GitHub

## Technical Details

- Encryption: AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API
